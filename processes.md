# Development approach:
* Create the datamodel as described in the project (three tables with relationships)
* Create sql queries to create, read, update, delete departments, roles and employees
* Capture scripts and save to a file so these can be used in the application 
* Create functions for employees, department, roles and company

## Employee Functions will:
* Create and Employee
* Read the employee information
* Update the employee manager
* Update the employee role
* Delete the employee 

## Role functions will:
* Create a role
* Read role
* Update the role
* Delete role

## Department Functions will: 
* Create a department
* Read department
* Delete department

## Company Functions will:
* List employee by department
* List the total salary budget by department

## CRUD functions test requirements:
* 2 roles - role1,role2
* 2 departments - deptA, deptB
* 3 employees - 2 employess in dept A, 1 employee in dept B
